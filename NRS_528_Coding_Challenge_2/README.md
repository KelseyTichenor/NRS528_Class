* Although this is labeled Coding Challenge 2, this is really the first coding challenge we did that involves Python use. 
* (Coding Challenge 1 was the README you saw when you first looked at this repo.)
* In this challenge, we had to accomplish five different tasks:
1. Using this list: **[1, 2, 3, 6, 8, 12, 20, 32, 46, 85]**, we needed to first make a new list that has all the elements less than 5 in it, and second, do the same thing again, just doing it in one line of code using the lambda function.
2. Using the lists: list_a = **['dog', 'cat', 'rabbit', 'hamster', 'gerbil']** and list_b = **['dog', 'hamster', 'snake']**, we needed to determine which items were present in both lists and which items share no overlap in the lists.
3. Given a single phrase, we needed to cound the occurrence of each word in this string: **string = 'hi dee hi how are you mr dee'** and print the word count. Doing this involved turning this string into a list using .split.
4. Here, we got to play around with print statements by asking users for their current age, then by defining retirement age = 65, we could calculate how many years the user (theoretically) had until retirement.
5. Lastly, we were given a scrabble dictionary and had to turn this into a word score calculator. This one was fun! :smile_cat:

To successfully submit this coding challenge, five Python files needed to be generated; one addressing each of the above tasks.
