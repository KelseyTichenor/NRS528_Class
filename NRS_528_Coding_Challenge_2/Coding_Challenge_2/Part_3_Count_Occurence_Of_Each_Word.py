# Coding Challenge 2: Part 3

# Given a single phrase, count the occurrence of each word:
# We'll be using the following string:
#   string = 'hi dee hi how are you mr dee'
# Count the occurrence of each word, and print the word plus the count.
# Here's a hint: you might want to "split" this into a list by a white space: " ".

words_in_string = ['hi', 'dee', 'hi', 'how', 'are', 'you', 'mr', 'dee']
