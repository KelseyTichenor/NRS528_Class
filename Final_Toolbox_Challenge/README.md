* This is my take on the Final Toolbox Challenge, assigned as the final project of NRS 528.
* Here, we had to make a working Python toolbox that can be used in ArcPro to run geospatial analyses.
* As part of this toolbox, I decided to use the Clip, Erase, and Count Overlapping Features tools due to their relative compatibility with Esri's Python toolbox structure.
* The provided datasets are the same ones I used for Coding Challenges 4 and 8: the Wetlands 2020 data and the Leaking Underground Storage Tanks data from RIGIS.
