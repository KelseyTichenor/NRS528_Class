## **About Me:**

* I study environmental science and management at URI. I'm a senior with less than one year 'til graduation :smile:
* I'm what you'd call a nontraditional student. After spending most of my twenties as a cook in various restaurants and nursing homes, I found myself craving a change of pace.
* I knew I wanted to work outside, and I knew I wanted to either work with wildlife (specifically aquatic life), or to work in protecting the places they live in. Environmental science seemed like a good fit, either way.
