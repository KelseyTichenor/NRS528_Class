## **About Me:**

* I study environmental science and management at URI. I'm a senior with less than one year 'til graduation :smile:
* I'm what you'd call a nontraditional student. After spending most of my twenties as a cook in various restaurants and nursing homes, I found myself craving a change of pace.
* I knew I wanted to work outside at least some of the time, and I knew I wanted to either work with wildlife (specifically aquatic life), or to work in protecting the places they live in. Environmental science seemed like a good fit, either way.

## **"So what do you wanna do once you get out?"**

* In a perfect world, I'd find a way to marry my two greatest interests related to the natural world: aquatic ecology and emerging pollutant remediation (specifically microplastics and/or PFAS)
* This ain't a perfect world though, so I'd be happy getting my feet wet doing anything even remotely related to one of the two.

## **Here's some highlights from one of my favorite internships to date**

These were all taken when I interned at the Hadley Falls Fishway in Holyoke, MA. I even got to help tag the sturgeon!

And this is of a juvenile sea lamprey that attached itself to our viewing window. It remains one of my favorite pictures to this day.
