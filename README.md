## **About Me:**

* I study environmental science and management at URI. I'm a senior with less than one year 'til graduation :smile:
* I'm what you'd call a nontraditional student. After spending most of my twenties as a cook in various restaurants and nursing homes, I found myself craving a change of pace.
* I knew I wanted to work outside at least some of the time, and I knew I wanted to either work with wildlife (specifically aquatic life), or to work in protecting the places they live in. Environmental science seemed like a good fit, either way.

## **"So what do you wanna do once you get out?"**

* In a perfect world, I'd find a way to marry my two greatest interests related to the natural world: aquatic ecology and emerging pollutant remediation (specifically microplastics and/or PFAS)
* This isn't a perfect world though, so I'd be happy getting my feet wet doing anything even remotely related to one of the two.

## **Here's some highlights from one of my favorite internships to date**

These were all taken when I interned at the Hadley Falls Fishway in Holyoke, MA. I even got to help tag this sturgeon!

This is of a juvenile sea lamprey that attached itself to our viewing window. It remains one of my favorite pictures to this day.

## **Oh yeah, did I mention that I'm a former URI Coastal Fellow?**

* I currently work in URI's Watershed Watch Lab, where we work with volunteers to monitor water bodies all across Rhode Island and in parts of Connecticut and Massachusetts. 
* Here's the poster I made as part of the Coastal Fellows program. I made the map in the middle of the poster using ArcGIS.

## **More Info About Me**

* I'll have been married for ten years this June.
* I have three cats. (Or do three cats have me?) From left to right, their names are Two, Tali, and Midna, who is also called Beans.

* I'm an equal opportunity tea enjoyer, but I'm a sucker for a good cuppa English (or Irish) breakfast, or Earl Grey :tea:
* I got out of the restaurant biz just in time; I still enjoy the heck out of cooking on my time off, especially when it comes to trying new techniques I haven't tried before.
  * Homemade broccoli cheddar soup wasn't the most complex thing I've ever made, but this is the best photo my Wal-Mart phone would allow.

* I enjoy sci-fi and fantasy literature. Two of my favorite authors are Tolkien and Brandon Sanderson.
* I also enjoy video games, as well as Dungeons and Dragons. 
  * (Okay, I'm a nerd. Busted. :space_invader:)
* The only time I left the U.S. was on a road trip to Canada with my mom, back before they required Americans to have passports to get in. We went up I-95 North until we hit the border, then kept going. We ended up somewhere in the middle-of-nowhere of Quebec. It was November, so there was nothing but miles and miles of snowy plains and silos.
  * I really hope that's not the last time I leave the U.S., there are still so many places I want to see! Ireland (or anywhere in the U.K., really) and Japan are at the top of my list.
* And what kind of environmental science student would I be if I didn't like hiking? There's all sorts of cool stuff to see outside, like mushroom clusters (left) and pokeweed (right) - not that I'd suggest eating either of them...
