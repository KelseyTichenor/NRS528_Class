I really liked this challenge. It's the first one where we got to see how Python works in the context of arcpy, which directly interfaces with ArcPro.
* For this challenge, we needed to find a tool we like in arcpy and get it to run using only Python code.
* We needed to provide some example data in order to see the code function properly. I chose the Wetlands 2020 dataset and the Leaking Underground Storage Tanks dataset, both from RIGIS.
* Our only requirements were to comment our code well and to ensure the code will run on any machine with only a single change to a base folder location.
* I chose to use the Near tool to identify leaking underground storage tanks within 100 meters of a wetland.
* As it turns out, there are 464 leaking underground storage tanks within 100m of a wetland in RI. Learn something new every day!
