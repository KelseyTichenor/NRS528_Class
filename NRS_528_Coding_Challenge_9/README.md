**Yes, this is an invasive spotted lanternfly. Figures, the pretty colorful bug has to be kill-on-sight around here!**

* For this coding challenge, we needed to use the arcpy.da module to undertake some basic partitioning of the Forest Health Works dataset from RIGIS.
* Using this dataset, we needed to:

1. Count how many individual records have photos, and how many do not (2 numbers), and print the results.
2. Count how many unique species there are in the dataset, and print the result.
3. Generate two shapefiles, one with photos and the other without.

* I messed up the counts for this one, and I do intend to address this before the May 10th deadline. 
* Once I do, I'll update this part of the README, I just wanted to get the Final Toolbox Challenge and all the README's out of the way before I pass out for the night.
