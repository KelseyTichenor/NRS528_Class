* The premise behind this coding challenge was simple: take some of our earlier code and functionalize it.
* The only rules are:
1. Do more than one thing to your input to the function.
2. Make sure the function takes two or more arguments.
3. Provide a .zip file of example data within the repo.

* For this challenge, I decided to use the code I wrote for Coding Challenge 4, where I determined the number of leaking underground storage tanks within 100 meters of a wetland in RI.
* This wasn't super hard to do, especially with prodigious use of os.path.join. Plus, the code looks much cleaner now.
