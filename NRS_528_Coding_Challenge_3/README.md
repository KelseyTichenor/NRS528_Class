* I had a ton of trouble finishing this challenge. Special thanks to Andy Davies at URI for his patience in guiding me towards understanding of what to do.
* In this challenge, we needed to accomplish three different tasks:

1. We needed to take this tree of directories and subdirectories:

</p>

replicate the tree using os.system or os.mkdirs, then delete it without deleting our entire hard drive.
* No hard drives were harmed in the completion of this task.

2. Here, we needed to use sys.argv to create a python script that can take a minimum of three arguments from a .bat file and then do something to them.
Three arguments needed to be used, the file needed to do something simple in 15 lines or less, and print/file generated output needed to be produced.

3. Using the following dataset: [Mauna Loa, Hawaii dataset](https://github.com/datasets/co2-ppm-daily/tree/master/data/)
we needed to use Python to calculate the following:
* Annual average for each year in the dataset.
* Minimum, maximum and average for the entire dataset.
* Seasonal average if Spring (March, April, May), Summer (June, July, August), Autumn (September, October, November) and Winter (December, January, February).
* Calculate the anomaly for each value in the dataset relative to the mean for the entire time series.
