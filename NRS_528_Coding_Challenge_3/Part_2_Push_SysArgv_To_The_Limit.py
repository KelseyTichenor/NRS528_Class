# Coding Challenge 3: Part 2

# Construct a rudimentary Python script that takes a series of inputs from a bat file,
#   and does something to them.
# The rules:
#   1. Minimum of three arguments to be used.
#   2. You must do something simple in 15 lines or less within the Python file.
#   3. Print or file generated output should be produced.

# The 15 lines will start on Line 11. Ready, Set, GO!
