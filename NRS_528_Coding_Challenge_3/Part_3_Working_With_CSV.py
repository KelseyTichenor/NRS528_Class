# Coding Challenge 3: Part 3

# Using the Atmospheric Carbon Dioxide Dry Air Mole Fractions
# from quasi-continuous daily measurements at Mauna Loa, Hawaii dataset,
# Use Python (csv) calculate the following:
#
# 1. Annual average for each year in the dataset.
# 2. Minimum, maximum and average for the entire dataset.
# 3. Seasonal average of:
#       Spring (March, April, May),
#       Summer (June, July, August),
#       Autumn (September, October, November)
#       and Winter (December, January, February).
# 4. Calculate the anomaly for each value in the dataset
#       relative to the mean for the entire time series.
